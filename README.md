## Architecture Overview

### Deployment

The React application is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. A CloudFront distribution is configured with the S3 bucket as its origin. Each deployment triggers a new cache invalidation in CloudFront to ensure that updated elements and features in the S3 bucket are immediately accessible to users.

## Functionality

The React application provides different routes based on the business logic:

- **Register**: Users can register to create an account.
- **Login**: After registration, users can log in to access the application.
- **Contacts**: The main functionality resides in the `/contacts` route, where users can manage their contacts. Access to this route requires authentication.
